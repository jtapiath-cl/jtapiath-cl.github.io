I'm a data engineer, sharing solutions to the problems I find on my day to day job. Also, my intention is to share opinions and opinionated comments about software, technology tendencies, technology applications to day to day issues, breakthroughs and other tech-related pieces. All the opinions shared on this site are personal.

My background is on engineering, actually. I love technology and always have, so my carreer started on financial services, on the software side, and later analytics took over everything. My main expertise lies, currently, on business intelligence and big data usage, specially Hive and Spark platforms. However, I'll always have a very special place in my heart for Microsoft Excel.

### Disclaimer

As much as I try to focus this on technology and its applications, you'll find here as well politics and tech-related approaches to it, current events related to news, and data analysis on public information. However, you must know that all personal opinions poured into this site are that, opinions. 

Also note that all applications are made to be shared. I'm a big open source supporter, and all the solutions shared here will be performed with open code (hosted with ‚ù§ on [GitHub](https://www.github.com)), and business intelligence solutions will all be shared using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com). I'm currently using WSL, which is great by itself, and I strongly recommend you use it too.
